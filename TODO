 Hacking on Dyce
=================

An issue tracker and the latest sources can be found at
<http://code.google.com/p/dyce/>. Currently, the project is in need
of:

 * Test suite improvements, especially:

   * dcalc.py -- currently untested.

   * tables.py -- currently only one bare test.

 * Documentation improvements:

   * tables.py -- currently undocumented, especially the file format.

   * dice.py -- currently undocumented, needs some examples

   * some example usages in a separate "examples" folder would be
     nice.

 * Extensions:

   * dcalc.py could use some extensions to the mini-language

   * tables.py is very rudimentary and could use extension

   * Any other ideas would be appreciated!
