==================
 Welcome to Dyce!
==================

Dyce is a toolkit for rolling dice. It's a friendly wrapper around
python's random module.

Dyce also has a mini-language for expressing random number patterns,
including common dice notation, making it ideal for easily storing
random number generators in config files.

Dyce has been tested on python 2.4 and 2.5. It will probably work on
2.6. Please let me know if you have any trouble with it.

Installation
============

Install Dyce using the standard distutils method:

  $ python setup.py install

Development and Testing
=======================

To develop and test Dyce, use buildout to set up your environment:

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout
  $ ./bin/nosetests -vxd

Everything's a little easier if you use `Vellum
<https://launchpad.net/vellum/>`_.

  $ vellum test

Hopefully, you'll find Dyce easy to work with and adapt.
